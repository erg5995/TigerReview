        <h2>FaQ</h2>

        <h5>How do I set up an account?</h5>
        <p>To set up an account, use the account page and sign up with your RIT email. If you don’t have an RIT email, you will not be allowed to create an account. We do this to ensure reviews are legitimate and are actually from real students and staff.</p>
        <h5>How can I leave a review?</h5>
        <p>Once you’ve signed up, just head to the page of the website you want to leave a review on and click the “Write a Review button” to get started. Reviews will need to be checked by moderators before uploading.</p>
        <h5>How do I know the reviews are from real students and staff?</h5>
        <p>Because we require an RIT email to create an account, the only people who are allowed to write reviews are those with a connection to RIT, this should ensure that most people leaving reviews are people who actually eat at these restaurants regularly. </p>
